Sentiment Analysis with BERT
This repository contains a sentiment analysis model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The program offers three functionalities: training the model, testing the model, and using the model for sentiment analysis.

Train Model
The training phase involves fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on a sentiment analysis task. This process can be quite time-consuming depending on the size of the training data and the computational resources available. To train the model, execute all the code blocks labeled with #Train Model.

Test Model
In the testing phase, the performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, recall, etc., on a separate testing dataset. To test the model, execute all the code blocks labeled with #Test Model.

Use Model
The usage phase allows you to perform sentiment analysis on new data using the trained model. Input an English sentence, and the model will output the sentiment of the sentence, either 'positive' or 'negative'. To use the model, execute all the code blocks labeled with #Use Model.
